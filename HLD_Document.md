### Implementation Plan

The solution will be delivered in 5 vertical shippable features:

- **Feature 1**: User Authentication System
- **Feature 2**: Basic To-Do CRUD Operations  
- **Feature 3**: Session Management & Persistence
- **Feature 4**: Enhanced To-Do Features
- **Feature 5**: Error Handling & Polish

### Key Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for API calls (95th percentile)
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **User Capacity**: Support 1000+ concurrent users
- **Security**: Zero data breaches, encrypted data at rest and in transit
- **Performance**: Page load times < 3 seconds on standard connections

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality
- **To-Do Item Management**: Create, read, update, delete, and mark items as complete
- **Data Persistence**: All user data stored securely in database with user isolation
- **Session Management**: Users remain logged in until explicit logout or session expiry
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates when data changes

## Assumptions

> **Note:** The following user experience requirements are assumptions made by the engineering team to ensure a high-quality user experience. These were not explicitly stated in the product requirements and are subject to review and approval by stakeholders.

### User Experience Requirements
- Intuitive Interface: Clean, modern design matching provided sketch
- Fast Interactions: Sub-second response times for user actions
- Error Handling: Clear, helpful error messages for all failure scenarios
- Loading States: Visual feedback during data operations
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design
  - *WCAG 2.1 AA* (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is an internationally recognized standard for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. Ensuring accessibility is important to provide equal access and usability for all users, improve user experience, and comply with legal and ethical standards.

### Data Management Requirements

- **User Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own to-do items
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Data Integrity**: ACID compliance for all database operations
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated daily database backups will be performed and stored securely in a separate location from the production database. Backups will be retained for 30 days, allowing for point-in-time recovery in case of data loss or corruption. Disaster recovery refers to the ability to restore the application and its data to a consistent state within 4 hours (RTO) in the event of catastrophic failure, such as hardware failure, accidental deletion, or security breach.
- **Data Export**: User ability to export their data (future enhancement)

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **API Response Time**: < 500ms for 95% of requests, < 2s maximum
- **Page Load Time**: < 3 seconds for initial page load
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 1000+ simultaneous users
- **Database Performance**: < 100ms query response time for standard operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability for future growth

### Security Requirements

- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication with configurable expiry
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
  - *bcrypt* is a password hashing function designed to be computationally intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. It automatically incorporates a salt (random data) and allows configuration of the number of hashing rounds, further increasing security. Using bcrypt ensures that even if the password database is compromised, attackers cannot easily recover the original passwords.
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest
  - *TLS 1.3* (Transport Layer Security) is the latest standard protocol for encrypting data sent over the internet, ensuring that information exchanged between users and the application cannot be intercepted or tampered with. *AES-256* (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys) is a widely used encryption algorithm for securing stored data, providing strong protection against unauthorized access. Using these standards helps safeguard sensitive user data both during transmission and while stored in the database.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

### Reliability Requirements

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour

### Usability Requirements

- **Browser Compatibility**: Support for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimized experience on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

## Database Schema Design

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### To-Do Items Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE todo_items (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    deadline TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    priority VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'medium' CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_todo_items_user_id ON todo_items(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_todo_items_completed ON todo_items(completed);
CREATE INDEX idx_todo_items_deadline ON todo_items(deadline);
```

### Database Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: Users → To-Do Items (one user can have many to-do items)
- **Cascade Delete**: When a user is deleted, all their to-do items are automatically deleted
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensures data integrity and referential integrity
