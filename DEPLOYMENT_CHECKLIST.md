## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. AWS Account Setup
- [ ] AWS account created and verified
- [ ] Billing information configured
- [ ] IAM user with appropriate permissions created
- [ ] AWS CLI installed and configured

### 2. Local Environment
- [ ] Docker installed and running
- [ ] Node.js installed (v18+)
- [ ] Git repository up to date
- [ ] All tests passing locally

### 3. Application Testing
- [ ] Backend API tested locally

- [ ] Docker images build without errors
- [ ] Database migrations tested

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: AWS Credentials
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID
# Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
# Enter your default region (e.g., us-east-1)
# Enter your default output format (json)
```

### Step 2: Choose Deployment Method

#### Option A: Automated Deployment (Recommended)
```powershell
# For Windows
cd aws
.\deploy.ps1

# For Linux/Mac
cd aws
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
1. Build and push backend Docker image
2. Build frontend
3. Deploy CloudFormation stack
4. Upload frontend to S3
5. Configure CloudFront

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
- [ ] CloudFormation stack created successfully
- [ ] ECS service running
- [ ] RDS database accessible
- [ ] Frontend accessible via CloudFront
- [ ] API endpoints responding
- [ ] Health checks passing

## 🔧 Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Database credentials saved securely
- [ ] JWT secret stored safely
- [ ] API URLs configured correctly
- [ ] CORS settings updated

### 2. Security
- [ ] Security groups configured
- [ ] SSL certificates applied (if using custom domain)
- [ ] Database encryption enabled
- [ ] Access logs enabled

### 3. Monitoring
- [ ] CloudWatch logs configured
- [ ] Health checks monitoring
- [ ] Error alerts set up
- [ ] Performance metrics enabled

## 📊 Expected Results

After successful deployment, you should have:

### URLs
- **Frontend**: `https://[cloudfront-distribution].cloudfront.net`
- **Backend API**: `http://[alb-dns-name]`
- **Database**: `[rds-endpoint].amazonaws.com`

### Infrastructure
- ✅ VPC with public/private subnets
- ✅ RDS PostgreSQL database
- ✅ ECS Fargate cluster
- ✅ Application Load Balancer
- ✅ S3 bucket for frontend
- ✅ CloudFront distribution
- ✅ Security groups and IAM roles

### Application Features
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Todo CRUD operations
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### Monthly Estimated Costs
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: $15-25
- **ECS Fargate**: $20-40
- **Application Load Balancer**: $20
- **CloudFront**: $5-10
- **S3**: $1-2
- **Data Transfer**: $5-15
- **Total**: $66-112/month

### Cost Optimization
- [ ] Set up billing alerts
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Consider reserved instances
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **ECR Login Failed**
   - Re-authenticate with AWS ECR
   - Check AWS credentials

2. **CloudFormation Stack Failed**
   - Check stack events
   - Verify IAM permissions
   - Delete and recreate if needed

3. **Frontend Not Loading**
   - Check S3 bucket contents
   - Invalidate CloudFront cache
   - Verify bucket policy

4. **Backend API Unreachable**
   - Check ECS service status
   - Verify ALB health checks
   - Check security groups

## 🧹 Cleanup (When Needed)

```bash
# Delete CloudFormation stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name todo-app-production

# Delete ECR repository
aws ecr delete-repository --repository-name todo-api --force

# Wait for deletion
aws cloudformation wait stack-delete-complete --stack-name todo-app-production
```
